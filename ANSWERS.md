# Sprint Challenge: Advanced React - Open Answer Questions

**Question 1**
- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

Unsure. I believe class components have an easier to follow path or the information is passed around clearer.

**Question 2**
- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

Three lifecycle methods are:
    (1) Mounting    : This is the initial rendering of adding components to the app. Enabling the use of setState.
    (2) Update      : This is where we can call the setState to update information based on the user interactions.
    (3) Unmount     : This is where we remove components that are no longer needed, mainly for clean up or refreshing. 

**Question 3**
- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

The purpose of a custom hook is (1) facilitation of DRY code through reusability.

**Question 4**
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

Testing our apps is important because it (1) minimizes the risk of bugs finding their way into production code and (2) acts as documentation for progress and validity.
